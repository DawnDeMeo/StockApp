# StockApp
Source code for StockApp, based on final project for Java Development Certification.

## Setup

The Resources folder contains a sample stock_info.xml file to use to test
option 4 - uploading an XML file to the local db.

Free version of Unibit API limits number of data points that can be accessed each month.
